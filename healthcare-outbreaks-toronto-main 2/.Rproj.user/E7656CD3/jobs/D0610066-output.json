Long-term care homes were significantly affected, comprising a majority of the outbreaks. Approximately 95% of these outbreaks were respiratory, with nearly two-thirds having COVID-19 as the first known cause. The charts highlight the distribution of occupied beds and room capacities across various shelters, demonstrating variations in capacity utilization, while a pie chart emphasizes the major shelter organizations. These findings reveal that facilities with higher occupancy rates, particularly long-term care homes, face greater challenges in outbreak management and containment, underscoring the need for enhanced public health measures. Targeted interventions in high-occupancy settings, such as long-term care homes and shelters, are critical. Future research should assess disease outbreaks in additional settings, such as workplaces and schools, to gain a broader understanding of the extent of this issue and improve public health strategies across various environments.'\n  bibliography:\n    - references.bib\n  \n"]
